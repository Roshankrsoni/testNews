**El Paso, Texas - July 7, 2023** - Patrick Crusius, a white supremacist who carried out a deadly shooting at a Walmart in 2019, has been sentenced to 90 consecutive life terms in prison by U.S. District Judge David Guaderrama. The attack resulted in the deaths of 23 people and left 22 others wounded, mainly targeting Hispanics. The sentencing comes as part of a plea agreement made in February, where Crusius pleaded guilty to the charges and agreed to the life sentences to avoid the federal death penalty. However, he still faces potential death penalty charges at the state level in Texas.

The plea agreement included 45 counts of violating hate crimes and 45 counts of using a firearm during a violent crime. During the court proceedings, Crusius remained silent, with his attorney, Joe Spencer, delivering a statement on his behalf. Spencer claimed that the shooter suffered from mental illness, which drove him to commit the massacre. However, prosecutors disputed this assertion, arguing that Crusius was fully aware of his actions when carrying out the attack.

Margaret Leachman, the first assistant U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas, expressed hope that the victims' families would find some closure and peace with the sentencing. She emphasized that the U.S. Attorney's Office would continue to aggressively prosecute those who commit acts of violence rooted in bias or hate, seeking justice for the victims and their loved ones.

The federal sentencing followed two days of emotional testimonies from witnesses, including survivors of the attack and relatives of the deceased. During the proceedings, impact statements were delivered directly to Crusius. Genesis Davila, who was present during the shooting at the age of 12 when her soccer coach was killed and her father wounded, expressed her hatred towards the shooter, stating, "I want you dead." She added, "Hell has a special place for you." Thomas Hoffman, who lost his father, Alexander Hoffman, called Crusius an "evil parasite" and remarked, "You are nothing without your weapon."

Prosecutors revealed that the shooter had driven over 600 miles (1,000 km) overnight from suburban Dallas to El Paso, armed with a Romanian derivative of the AK-47 and hollow-point ammunition. Prior to the attack, Crusius posted a manifesto on the internet, citing the "Hispanic invasion of Texas" as his motivation. He claimed to be defending his country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by this perceived invasion.

The trial received extensive coverage. The case has sparked widespread discussions on issues such as gun control, hate crimes, and mental health.
